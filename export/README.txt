Step by Step Instruction:

1. Unzip Joomla2WordPress.zip
2. Edit config.php and enter all missing values
3. Upload files to /export on your server
4. Add Categories in wordpress which you want to import into
5. Open www.yoursite.com/export/index.php on a browser
6. Select either a Joomla Section, Category or Links Category
7. Select a Wordpress Category to import into
8. Repeat Steps 5-7 till all of your articles have been imported
9. Enjoy and Spread the word!

Notes: 

-minor glitch: If you create a WP category which is empty (has no posts), the articles will import just fine, but the category may not appear in the categories widget until you open at least one post in that category in /wp-admin and just hit save.
